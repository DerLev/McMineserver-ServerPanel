=== McMineserver DIY Server ===

You found this file and your DIY server is "installed"

Why "installed" ???
  This is a DIY server so YOU have to do the heavy lifting.

How do I install my server then ???
  You just put your jar-file of the server into the server's directory.
  Then you have to rename the file to server.jar OR go to the startup tab and paste in
  your file name under "Server Jar File".

But how to do forge or something that needs libraries ???
  In that case you need to run the forge installer on your computer, then zip the jar-file
  AND the libraries folder and upload the zip to your server.
  You then can uncompress the files on the server by pressing the three dots on the file.

Any more questions ???

Good luck and have fun

=== ADDITION ===

Maybe you know GitHub and Gits AND what a .gitignore is.
If you don't, it's a file where you can exclude files from being uploaded to GitHub.

Anyway the panel has the same functionality.
You can exclude files from being backed up in the .pteroignore file.
The .pteroignore is already created and already excludes this README.txt
and the libraries folder used by forge for libraries.
You can just add folders like a backup folder from a plugin/mod.
